Researches related to breast cancer prediction has been carried out in

the past some of which are:

Means algorithm. 2015 International Conference on Radar, Antenna, Microwave, Electronics and

Telecommunications (ICRAMET), IEEE, 2015.

The reason to carry out our own research was to:

¢ Increase the accuracy of predictions as this can lead to saving a
patient at an early stage.

* Reduce the complexity of the model so that prediction model i .
inexpensive ,time and complexity wise, to construct. Hence,
increasing the efficiency of prediction. | *] |
