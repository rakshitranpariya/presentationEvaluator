Algorithms:

* Logistic Regression :

Logistic Regression is an appropriate type of regression model when we are
sure that our dependent variable is of binary type. Logistic regression is used
to find the relationship between one dependent variable (which is binary in
nature) and one or more independent variables.

* Decision Tree:

Decision tree is a structure where each inner node represents a test on
attribute (such as if a coin when flipped will land on its tails or head), e

its branches represents the outcome of that test or attribute and each

node represents a class label (that is the decision taken after taking int
account all the attributes). | © |
