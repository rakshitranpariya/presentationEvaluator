Conclusion:

* We implemented two machine learning algorithms namely Decision Tree
Classifier and Logistic Regression for prediction of breast cancer, and
compared the accuracies of both to find which one of the two will be best
suited for the prediction.

* We came to know that Decision Tree Classifier is the best suited- algorithm
for prediction as by using it we had almost pinpoint prediction accuracy [on
“Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set”].

* Hence, given the features according to that of this dataset, we can pro7i=*
breast cancer with almost pinpoint accuracy using our Decision Tree
Classifier algorithm.
